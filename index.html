            Hello and welcome! Did you ever find yourself searching for something online? How long does it take to get a response from your search? You search for something and you get a response back in no time. That's really something, isn't it? But did you ever think about how it all happens? </p>
            <p class="just">You open your favorite app on your device and you're instantly connected to the world. This is all made possible because two devices connect and communicate via a wired or wireless connection, forming something called a network. You can connect multiple devices to this network. But this becomes very complicated very quickly, as each device needs to connect to every other device to communicate effectively. This problem is solved by something called a network switch that connects multiple devices and allows them to communicate with each other. The network switch can connect to other network switches, and now two networks can connect. These network switches then connect to more network switches until you have something called an interconnected network. This interconnected network has another name that you might be familiar with. It's called the Internet.

              A server is a computer that runs applications and services ranging from websites to instant messaging. It's called a server because it provides a service to another computer and its user also known as the client. Is typically stored in something called a data center with hundreds or thousands of other servers, all running different services connected to the internet. There are many different systems in data centers to ensure that servers have continuous power, continuous internet connection and are kept called 24 hours per day. Did you know that there are data centers located all around the world? Many websites use these to allow you to access your content quickly from the data center nearest to you. </p>
              <p class="just">The data center servers are built based on the service purpose. For example, if the server is only to be used for storing images, it might have a lot of hard drive space. Whereas a server computing complex calculations might need a fast processor and a lot of memory. This is usually referred to as a server <strong>Hardware.</strong> The physical components of a server. Once the server hardware is installed in the data center, a piece of code can now run. The code that runs on the hardware is commonly known as software. One way I like to remember this is to think of hardware as something you can physically touch and is difficult to change as you need to physically replace components. <strong>Software</strong> is soft or easy to change. You just replace the code running on the server. A web server has many functions which includes website storage and administration, data storage, security and managing email. Another primary function is to handle something known as a web request. When you open a browser on your device and type the name of the website, it's the job of the web server to send you back to that website's content. This process is known as the request response cycle!

           You may have heard the terms webpages and websites, but what's the difference? A web page is a document that displays images, texts, videos and other content in the web browser, a website is a collection of webpages that link together.

           A web browser, or browser for short, is a software application that you use to browse the World Wide Web. It works by sending a request to a web server and then receives a response containing the content that is to be displayed on the screen of your device. Once the browser is open on your device, there is the address bar where you input the address of the website that you want to visit. The address is commonly known as the Uniform Resource Locator or URL for short. </p>
           <p class="just"> The URL contains the protocol or the HTTP, the domain name, usually the name of the website, and the file path, or the path to the page that is displayed. When you make a request using this URL, the browser and server communicate using a protocol known as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP. Once the web browser receives the content, it displays it on the screen of your device. This exchange of information is made possible by something known as the request response cycle.

           By now, you know that websites and files are stored on web servers located in datacenters. But what if you wanted to create your own website? Do you really need your own datacenter with specialized hardware and software? Thankfully, the answer is no. Developers can launch websites to the Internet using something known as web hosting.

             Web hosting is a service where you place your website and files on the hosting companies web server. You're essentially renting the space in return for stable and secure storage. You don't need to be accompanied to use a web host. Individuals can rent space too!
